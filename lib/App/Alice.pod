=head1 NAME

App::Alice - an Altogether Lovely Internet Chatting Experience

=head1 SYNPOSIS

    arthur:~ leedo$ alice
    Location: http://localhost:8080/

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Alice is an IRC client that can be viewed in the web browser. Alice runs
in the background and keeps a message buffer, so when a browser connects it will
display the 100 most recent messages for each channel. This allows the
user to close their browser while alice continues to collect new messages.

Alice also logs messages to an SQLite database. These logs are searchable 
through the web interface.

=head1 USAGE

Installation will add a new `alice` command to start the alice server.
When the command is run it will start the daemon and print the application URL.

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item /j[oin] [-network] $channel

Takes a channel name as an argument. It will attempt to join this channel
on the server of the channel that you typed the command into.

=item /close

Closes the current tab, even private message tabs. If used in a channel
it will also part the channel.

=item /clear

This will clear the current tab's messages from your browser. It will also 
clear the tab's message buffer so when you refresh your browser the messages 
won't re-appear (as they normally would.)

=item /msg [-network] $nick [$msg]

Takes a nick as an argument. This will open a new tab for private messaging
with a user. Only works in a channel.

=item /whois $nick

Takes a nick as an argument. This will print some information about the
supplied user.

=item /quote $string

Sends a string as a raw message to the server.

=item /t[opic] [$topic]

Takes an optional topic string. This will display the topic for the current tab.
If a string is supplied, it will attempt to update the channel's topic.
Only works in a channel.

=item /n[ames]

This will print all of the nick's in the current tab in a tabular format.

=item /me $string

Sends a string as an ACTION to the channel.

=item /w[indow] $number

Focus the supplied tab number. Also accepts "next" or "prev"

=head1 NOTIFICATIONS

If you get a message with your nick in the body, while no browsers are
connected, a notification will be sent to either Growl (if running on
OS X) or using libnotify (on Linux.) Alice does not send any notifications
if a browser is connected (the exception being Fluid SSB which will
Growl if unfocused). This is something that will probably become 
configurable over time.

=head1 MOBILE INTERFACE

Alice has an iphone style sheet, but it may work well in other mobile browsers
as well. Any reports would be much appreciated.
